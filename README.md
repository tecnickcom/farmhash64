## Description

FarmHash is a family of hash functions.

**FarmHash64** is a 64-bit fingerprint hash function that generates a hash value for a given string. It is optimized for speed and produces well-distributed hashes, but it is not intended for cryptographic use.

The **FarmHash32** function is also available, providing a 32-bit fingerprint hash for strings.

All FarmHash algorithms build upon prior work by Jyrki Alakuijala, Austin Appleby, Bob Jenkins, and others.

This project is a multi-language port of the original Fingerprint64 (`farmhashna::Hash64`) implementation from Googleâ€™s FarmHash ([github.com/google/farmhash](https://github.com/google/farmhash)), maintained by Nicola Asuni (Tecnick.com).

## Getting Started

The reference code of this application is written in header-only C language.

A Makefile is available to allows building the project in a Linux-compatible system with simple commands.  
All the artifacts and reports produced using this Makefile are stored in the *target* folder inside each language directory.  

To see all available options:
```
make help
```

Use the command ```make all``` to build and test all the implementations.
